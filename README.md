This is based on the excellent tutorial by KristianEkman on Mnist handwritten digit recognition, which explains the fundamentals of artificial neural network - https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1273125/Handwritten-digits-reader-UI

The ANN model is reimplemented on ConvNetSharp, which is a full-fledged neural network framework using C#, and allows for conversion to more complex convolutional neural network to yield better results. Code is provided for data augmentation which includes translation, rotation, and scaling of the images to train the neural network.
